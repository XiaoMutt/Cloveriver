# Cloveriver
An online scheduler

Cloveriver is a side project of Clover, a Simple Lab Information Management System (LIMS). It is used to manage and schedule lab instruments/equipment/rooms.

For Clover, please visit https://sourceforge.net/projects/cloversystem/ .

Cloveriver is very easy to use. Please visit https://sourceforge.net/p/cloveriver/wiki/Home/ for instructions.

I wrote this project in a hurry. The codes are not pretty but are fully functional. This has been tested for over 1 year.
